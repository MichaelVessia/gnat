# General Network Access Tester

General Network Access Tester is an Android application which helps IT departments, network administrators, or anyone that wants to monitor a network that they have access to.

GNAT is targetting network administrators who have mobile devices connecting to their network and would like more information about connection attempts, connection drops, and other network issues. It should reduce the time an IT team needs to troubleshoot why people are unable to connect to their network.

Within the mobile application, users will be able to enter a number of configuration options.  The network connection that will be attempted will be based upon these configuration options.  The result of this connection attempt will be logged locally on the device if anything goes wrong. Although the application tests network access, it ultimately assumes that the user has access to the internet.  If there is an initial connection error, logs will be stored locally until a connection is made, at which point it will store logs on the server that the administrator has configured, with local backups.
