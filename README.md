# General Network Access Tester



Gnat is designed to test networks. A user can input a number of configuration options, allowing them to choose what network they want to be tested, where the results will be sent, and other useful configurations.  Gnat will attempt to connect to that network.  If there is any issues with the network such as the inability to connect or the inability to download a resource at a specified IP, Gnat will generate logs and send them to the user based on the method they specified in their configuration.
